Terminal activities continue as normal, and there has been no announcement from Mozambican authorities suggesting a review, suspension or alteration of the concession arrangements.\n\n## Expansion plans under a new spotlight [...] The two carriers said the move would be limited in scope and carefully managed. Additional Gemini services — specifically the AE12 and AE15 — may also be routed through the Red Sea and Suez Canal at a later stage, subject to security conditions.\n\nFurther guidance to customers and stakeholders will be issued if and when those changes are implemented. No wider adjustments to the Gemini network are planned at this stage.\n\nMaersk and Hapag-Lloyd stressed that the rerouting has been designed to minimise disruption to customers while maintaining the schedule reliability that underpins the Gemini Cooperation. [...] First, recent background reports point to major challenges facing the development of the soft infrastructure of customs and regulations. Others have pointed to the corridor’s unclear commercial viability. Ships having to call at the secondary port of Lobito will incur higher costs. There’s also competition from other routes – mostly, the Chinese-built Tazara railway, connecting Zambia to Dar-es-Salaam.\n\nSecond, the economic model at the heart of the Lobito corridor is anything but a break with exploitative extractivism. Throughout Angolan history, primary commodities have left the country, while hopes for broad-based growth have repeatedly been frustrated.\n\nBeat Simon, Chief Operating Officer – Logistics at DP World, said the data confirms that disruption is no longer a short-term phenomenon.\n\n“Supply-chain disruption is no longer a temporary shock; it is a recurring drain on growth, profitability and customer trust,” Simon said. “In some regions, businesses are effectively planning around the loss of weeks or months of productive time each year.”\n\nHowever, the report notes that the regions under the greatest pressure are also responding with urgency. More than 90% of businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa and the GCC expect to increase investment in logistics over the next year, while 86% of companies in MENA plan to do the same. [...] Companies strengthening multiple logistics capabilities — from factory logistics and inbound flows to warehousing and digital coordination — report significantly lower disruption costs. In consumer goods, firms investing in four or more logistics areas recorded disruption costs around 76% lower than low-investment peers.\n\nCustomer impact is now close to universal, with between 80% and 95% of respondents reporting increased complaints linked to logistics failures.\n\nLasting reputational damage, however, is concentrated in specific markets, notably Sub-Saharan Africa and France, while firms in North America and the UK report higher complaint volumes but more resilient brand perceptions. [...] Africa Ports & Ships\n\nGlobal trade is no longer recovering from isolated shocks but operating under sustained strain, with companies across parts of the Global South losing months of productivity, millions of dollars and long-term customer trust as supply-chain disruption becomes a defining feature of the operating environment.\n\nThese are among the conclusions of DP World’s Without Logistics report, based on a global survey of 680 senior logistics and supply-chain decision-makers across eight industries and nine regions.\n\nThe study finds that while disruption is now commonplace worldwide, its impact is most severe and persistent in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states.\n\n#### What you should know\n\nThe Lagos State Government routinely cordons off roadways, partially or fully, for events like marathons, road rehabilitation, and repairs.
